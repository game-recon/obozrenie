## Project status note (2016-06-13)
Right now Obozrenie is considered feature-complete and ready for general usage.

However, the fact that I chose Python as the language of code led to significant hurdles in terms of application performance, maintainability and shipping today. I am looking into rewriting Obozrenie in a lower level language (like Vala or Go) for better speed and maintainability.

Therefore, new **features** are not likely to be implemented in this codebase. **Game support**, however, will expand on request. Nevertheless you are welcome to voice your wishes at issue tracker.

## Overview
Obozrenie is a game server browser that can be used to access information about and connect to multiplayer servers.

## Features
- Fast, fully threaded stat engine
- Easy to use, elegant, uncluttered GUI
- Supports various backends, designed for modularity.

## Get it
### Docker
Obozrenie project ships Ubuntu-based Docker image containing Obozrenie browser, runnable out of the box. It is only intended for quick test drive since custom GTK+ theming, game launching or settings storage is not available in this version.
#### Install / update
    docker pull vorot93/obozrenie
#### Run
    docker run -it --rm -e LANG=$LANG -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix vorot93/obozrenie
### Manual
    git clone https://github.com/vorot93/obozrenie.git
    cd obozrenie
    ./obozrenie-gtk

## Technical details
Obozrenie is written in Python, with use of PyGObject libraries. It consists of several backends for master server interaction, core module and different GUIs.

* Backends query master servers and receive the server list.
* Core library forms multi-layered tables with game settings and server information (Game Table) and Obozrenie-wide configuration (Settings Table).
* GTK+ GUI shows this information in a user-friendly form.
